# textAnalysis.io-Chrome-Extension
this is a chrome extension I made that analyzes highlighted text in the browser on the click of a button, calling my text analysis classifier end point.  I have encountered many hurtles getting this project working, but I am happy that it finally works.  I am planning on improving it soon.
